a. What is the regular expressions to validate vehicle registration number (Eg:   TS10AB1234 )
->
A regular expression, often abbreviated as "regex", is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It's a powerful tool used for matching patterns in strings. 

Example to validate vechile registration number is:


let regNumber = "TS10AB1234";
let regex = /^[A-Z]{2}\d{2}[A-Z]{2}\d{4}$/;

if (regex.test(regNumber)) {
    console.log("Valid vehicle registration number");
} else {
    console.log("Invalid vehicle registration number");
}

 

b. What are data structure? Why do we need?

-> a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. Data structures provide a means to manage and organize data in a systematic and efficient manner,
 allowing for various operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, sorting, and traversal.

why do we need:

->
Data structures are essential in computer science and programming for several reasons:

Organization of Data: Data structures provide a way to organize and structure data in a logical and efficient manner. They enable us to store, 
retrieve, and manipulate data effectively, making it easier to manage large volumes of information.

Efficient Data Access: Different data structures are optimized for different types of operations. For example, arrays provide fast random access to elements, 
while linked lists are efficient for insertions and deletions. By choosing the appropriate data structure, we can perform operations on data more efficiently.

Optimized Algorithms: Many algorithms rely on specific data structures to achieve optimal performance. For example
, sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort often perform better when used with certain data structures like arrays or trees.

Memory Management: Data structures help in efficient memory management by allocating memory dynamically and deallocating it when it's no longer needed.
 This helps prevent memory leaks and ensures that resources are used effectively.

Abstraction and Encapsulation: Data structures provide a level of abstraction that allows programmers to work with data at a higher conceptual level,
 without needing to understand the underlying implementation details. This makes programs easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

Problem Solving: Many computational problems can be solved more efficiently using the appropriate data structures. For example, problems involving searching, 
sorting, graph traversal, and dynamic programming often require the use of specific data structures to achieve optimal solutions.

Scalability: As the size of data grows, the choice of data structure becomes increasingly important for maintaining performance and scalability. 
Using the right data structure can help ensure that programs remain efficient even as data volumes increase.


c. What are the applications of stack and queue in real-time applications?
->Applications of Stacks:

Function Call Stack: Stacks are commonly used in programming languages to manage function calls and local variables. When a function is called,
 its parameters and local variables are pushed onto the stack, and when the function returns, they are popped off the stack.

Expression Evaluation: Stacks are used in evaluating arithmetic expressions, parsing, and converting infix expressions to postfix or prefix notation. For example,
 the postfix notation is evaluated using a stack-based algorithm.

Undo Mechanism: Many applications implement an undo mechanism using a stack. Each operation that modifies the state of the application is pushed onto a stack,
 allowing users to undo operations by popping them off the stack.

Backtracking Algorithms: Backtracking algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS), often use stacks to maintain a record of the current state and backtrack when necessary to explore alternative paths.

Memory Management: Stacks are used in memory management to allocate and deallocate memory for local variables and function calls. For example,
 the call stack in operating systems manages function calls and their associated memory.

Applications of Queues:

Job Scheduling: Queues are used in job scheduling systems to manage tasks or jobs that need to be processed in a first-come, first-served order.
 For example, in operating systems, the print queue manages print jobs.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS algorithm, used in graph traversal, employs queues to explore neighboring nodes level by level.
 It is widely used in network routing, social network analysis, and web crawling.

Message Queues: Queues are used in messaging systems to facilitate communication between different components or processes.
 Messages are enqueued by one process and dequeued by another process for processing.

Buffering: Queues are used for buffering data in systems where the producer and consumer operate at different speeds. For example, 
in data streaming applications, data is buffered in a queue before being processed.

Traffic Management: Queues are used in traffic management systems to control the flow of vehicles at intersections or toll booths.
 Vehicles wait in queues until it's their turn to proceed.

Task Scheduling: In real-time systems, queues are used to schedule tasks or events based on their priority or deadline. 
Tasks with higher priority are dequeued and executed before lower priority tasks.
