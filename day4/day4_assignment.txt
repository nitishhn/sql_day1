1.What Is a Regular Expression?
->A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
  When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
 A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations


2. How to use Regular Expression?
->
Ex 1:
We use a string to do a search for "school" in a string:

    let text = "Visit school!";
let n = text.search("school");

Ex 2:
 We use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "school" in a string:
let text = "Visit School";
let n = text.search(/school/i);


Ex 3:

The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:
let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
let result = text.replace("Microsoft", "Hexaware");

Ex4 :

Use a case insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with Hexaware in a string:

let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
let result = text.replace(/microsoft/i, "hexaware");


3. Array Methods in javascript
->

   a.The map() method of Array instances creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
     Ex:
const array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

// Pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map((x) => x * 2);

console.log(map1);
// Expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]


  b.The find() method of Array instances returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.
 If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

  Ex :const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

const found = array1.find((element) => element > 10);

console.log(found);
// Expected output: 12

  c.FindIndex()
The findIndex() method returns the index (position) of the first element that passes a test.

The findIndex() method returns -1 if no match is found.

The findIndex() method does not execute the function for empty array elements.

EX:const ages = [3, 10, 18, 20];
       ages.findIndex(checkAge);

   function checkAge(age) {
    return age > 18;
     }

d.The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
The filter() method does not change the original array.
EX:
   const ages = [32, 33, 16, 40];
const result = ages.filter(checkAdult);

function checkAdult(age) {
  return age >= 18;
}
